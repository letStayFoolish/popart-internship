### What I learned

While working on this landing webpage using only HTML and CSS3 with the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, I gained valuable insights and experiences that enhanced my understanding of web development and best practices. Here are some key takeaways from the project:

1. Modular Structure with BEM: Implementing the BEM methodology helped me create a clear and organized structure for my HTML and CSS code. Breaking down components into blocks, elements, and modifiers made the codebase more maintainable and easier to work with.

2. Component Reusability: By designing components as self-contained entities, I found that I could easily reuse them throughout the webpage. This not only saved development time but also ensured consistency in styling and behavior.

3. Naming Conventions: Using BEM naming conventions consistently improved code readability and made it easier to understand the relationships between different parts of the webpage. This naming approach also helped prevent naming conflicts and made collaboration with team members smoother.

4. CSS Flexbox/Grid for Layout: I discovered the power of CSS Flexbox and Grid for creating responsive and flexible layouts. Leveraging these layout techniques allowed me to achieve a visually appealing and consistent design across various screen sizes.

5. Responsive Design: Through hands-on experience, I learned how to use media queries effectively to create a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different devices and viewport sizes.

6. CSS Styling Techniques: Working on this project exposed me to various CSS styling techniques, such as transitions, transforms, and pseudo-elements, that helped enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the webpage.
